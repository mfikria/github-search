## Architecture & Tech Stack Choices

### Why This Structure?

**Component-Based Architecture**: Organized into reusable UI components (`/components`) for maintainability and consistency across the app.

**State Management**: Zustand chosen over Redux for its simplicity and minimal boilerplate while providing powerful state management capabilities.

**Service Layer**: Separated API logic (`/services`) from UI components for better testability and code organization.

**Custom Hooks**: Extracted reusable logic (`/hooks`) like debouncing and infinite scroll for better code reuse.

### Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15**: Latest features, App Router for better performance, built-in optimization
- **TypeScript**: Type safety reduces bugs and improves developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first approach for rapid UI development and consistent design
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management without Redux complexity
- **Axios**: Robust HTTP client with interceptors for API token handling
- **Jest + Testing Library**: Industry standard for reliable testing
